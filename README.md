# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## What The Project Entails

This is an application to save all your everyday tasks. Once completed you can successfully deleted them. Also, you tasks persist on reloads. Hence, you do need worry about browser refresh affecting your stored tasks...

# Thanks...
